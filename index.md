### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was creating a program to find the date difference of two dates.
    I enjoyed this lab because figuring out the date difference between two dates 
    seemed practical. Alongside that, testing the program with different dates 
    was fun to play around with.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was creating a program that finds the average of scores given by 
    judges. I enjoyed this lab because figuring out how to take the highest and lowest 
    scores out of the equation was rewarding. Plus, it is a fair way to determine the 
    average score of something. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was creating a program that generates a gif of a color gradient. 
    I enjoyed this lab because this was the first time we were working with images. 
    The end result of the code being a gif of the color gradient was exciting to see.
